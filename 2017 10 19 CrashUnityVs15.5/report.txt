Unity Editor crush with fixed statement compiled by VS 15.5 Preview

1. What happened

The Unity editor crushes.

2. How we can reproduce it using the example you attached

Run, then immediately this project will crush.

3. Cause

This crush is caused by the Class1.Unsafe method in the Lib/Class1.cs.
This method contains `fixed (char* ps = s)` where `s` is `string`.

The crush occurs only if the Class1.cs is compiled by Visual Studio 15.5 Preview.
If you replace Lib155.dll by Lib154.dll (compiled by VS 15.4), there is no crush.

Lib/154.il and Lib/155.il are decompilation results from Lib/Lib154.dll and Lib/Lib155.dll respectively.
Difference between them is:

***** .\154.il
    IL_0003:  ldloc.1
    IL_0004:  conv.i
    IL_0005:  stloc.0
***** .\155.IL
    IL_0003:  ldloc.1
    IL_0004:  conv.u
    IL_0005:  stloc.0
*****

conv.i in 154.il is changed to conv.u in 155.il.
